 * boundBuf.c
 *
 * Producer-consumer problem using shared memory.
 * Shared memory consists of buffer, in, and out.
 * Producer continously produces an item (integer) and 
 * places it in buffer. Consumer gets items from the buffer.
 * Item is initially 123 and is incremented each time
 * the producer generates a new item.
 * Both producer and consumer sleep between succesive calls 
 * for a random number of seconds to simulate speed 
 * difference between the two processes.
 * In this program each process loops 10 times.
 *
 * Compile: gcc boundBuf.c -lrt
